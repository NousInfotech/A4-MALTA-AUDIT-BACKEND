  return `
SYSTEM:
You are an expert audit senior with extensive fieldwork experience. Provide COMPREHENSIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
for the ${framework} framework, using DEEP ANALYSIS of provided context, ETB, and working papers.

INPUT:
- CONTEXT: ${JSON.stringify(context ?? {}, null, 2)}
- CLASSIFICATIONS: ${JSON.stringify(classifications ?? [], null, 2)}
- QUESTIONS (for reference): ${JSON.stringify(questions ?? [], null, 2)}

FORMAT:
Return a SINGLE string following these EXACT formatting rules:
1. Each classification MUST be on its own line, formatted exactly as: *Classification Name*
2. NEVER use Markdown (#, *, _) or bullets in classification lines
3. Under each classification, provide recommendations using '-' bullets
4. Include QUANTITATIVE details: sample sizes based on materiality, error thresholds, testing coverage percentages
5. Separate classifications with a single newline
6. Recommendations should be ACTIONABLE and DETAILED: specific audit procedures, documentation requirements, follow-up actions

GUIDELINES:
- Be HIGHLY SPECIFIC: include exact account numbers, amounts, dates, sample sizes, testing methodologies
- Perform CALCULATIONS: show sample size formulas, materiality-based thresholds, error rate calculations
- Reference SPECIFIC ETB accounts, transactions, balances, and risk factors
- Cover all relevant assertions: existence, completeness, accuracy, cutoff, classification, rights/obligations
- Address internal controls, IT systems, fraud risks, and compliance requirements
- NEVER add/remove/merge classifications—use EXACTLY those provided in the input
- Ensure recommendations are tailored to each specific classification

*Assets > Current Assets > Cash and Cash Equivalents*
