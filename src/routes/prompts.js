- Section with fields (object with sectionId and fields array): {section}

TASK:
For the provided section, produce EXTREMELY DETAILED answers for ALL fields AND generate comprehensive section-specific recommendations.
- Perform DEEP ANALYSIS of client profile, materiality, and ETB data to provide context-specific responses
- Calculate precise values using ETB data when numeric fields are requested
- Identify risk patterns, control weaknesses, and compliance gaps from the context
- Do NOT restate labels/help/options/content/etc.
- Do NOT add or remove fields.
- Preserve original field "key" identity; provide only "answer" for each.
- If information is insufficient, use conservative, professional defaults based on audit best practices and industry standards
- NEVER leave any answer empty or unanswered - provide detailed, context-appropriate responses with specific calculations and references
- Respect types:
  - text/textarea: string (provide detailed explanations with specific examples and references to ETB accounts)
  - checkbox: boolean (with justification in adjacent text fields if needed)
  - multiselect: string[] (select ALL applicable options with rationale)
  - number/currency: number (provide precise calculations showing methodology: base amount * percentage * adjustment factors)
  - table: array of row objects with keys exactly matching the provided "columns" (include ALL relevant data points from ETB)
  - group: object of { childKey: boolean|string|number } for the defined child fields
- Answers must be self-consistent with materiality and ETB data, showing clear relationships between amounts
- Additionally, provide EXTENSIVE section-specific recommendations based on the answers with specific audit procedures, testing approaches, and risk mitigation strategies
- MUST ENSURE that All AI-generated procedures are fully aligned with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). For every answer and recommendation generated, the corresponding ISA reference will be explicitly cited, along with the applicable financial reporting framework —(e.g., ISA 315 – Identifying and Assessing Risks of Material Misstatement ). This guarantees that all outputs remain compliant with professional auditing standards and tailored to the framework under which the audit is being performed.

- Return ONLY valid JSON. No prose. No code fences.

- Every field MUST include exactly these keys (when relevant):

- \`visibleIf\` supports:
  - equality on select/checkbox: { "some_key": ["Option A","Option B"] } or { "some_flag": [true] }
  - numeric operators: { "some_number_key": [{ "operator": ">=" | ">" | "<=" | "<" | "=", "value": <number> }] }
  - existence: { "some_key": [{ "operator": "not_empty" }] }
- Keys must be snake_case and unique per section.
- Labels must be short, human-readable questions.
- Help must be concrete and practical (1–2 sentences) with specific materiality-based thresholds and examples
- \`options\` only for select/multiselect; options MUST be concise strings.
- No answers. This is Step-1 question generation only.
- DO NOT use the pilcrow (¶) symbol

- Client Profile JSON: {clientProfile}
- Materiality (numeric): {materiality}
- ETB rows (array, summarized): {etbRows}
- Section: {section}
- Allowed Field Palette (examples only, not actual fields): {fieldPalette}

GOAL
- Generate a COMPREHENSIVE set of DEEP, ANALYTICAL questions (fields) for the specific section that:
  - are extensively tailored to the client's industry, size, complexity, and risk profile
  - incorporate detailed analysis of ETB data patterns, unusual transactions, and risk indicators
  - include quantitative thresholds based on materiality calculations (e.g., "transactions exceeding 5% of materiality")
  - address specific compliance requirements for the client's industry and jurisdiction
  - cover all relevant assertions: existence, completeness, rights/obligations, valuation, presentation
  - include questions about internal controls, fraud risks, going concern, related parties, and estimates
- Create 25-35 DEEP questions per section to ensure exhaustive coverage of all risk areas
- Include questions that require analysis of ETB patterns, ratio calculations, trend analysis, and risk assessment
- Implement COMPLEX branching logic with \`visibleIf\` to create adaptive questioning based on risk factors
- Use the field palette as style guidance ONLY (don't copy keys; create new, unique keys)
- MUST ENSURE that All AI-generated procedures are fully aligned with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). For every procedure generated, the corresponding ISA reference will be explicitly cited, along with the applicable financial reporting framework —(e.g., ISA 315 – Identifying and Assessing Risks of Material Misstatement ). This guarantees that all outputs remain compliant with professional auditing standards and tailored to the framework under which the audit is being performed.

INDUSTRY/ETB HOOKS (perform DEEP analysis to shape questions)
- Analyze ETB for high-risk accounts: calculate ratios, identify unusual patterns, flag transactions near period-end
- Detect complex accounting areas: revenue recognition, financial instruments, leases, provisions, impairments
- Identify related party transactions, unusual journal entries, significant estimates and judgments
- For regulated industries: include specific compliance requirements, licensing conditions, regulatory thresholds
- Calculate materiality-based thresholds for testing scope, sample sizes, and error thresholds
- Incorporate fraud risk indicators, control environment assessment, and IT system considerations
