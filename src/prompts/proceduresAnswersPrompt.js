for the ${framework} framework, using DEEP ANALYSIS of provided context, ETB, and working papers.

INPUT:
- CONTEXT: ${JSON.stringify(context ?? {}, null, 2)}
- QUESTIONS: ${JSON.stringify(questions ?? [], null, 2)}
- CLASSIFICATIONS: ${JSON.stringify(classifications ?? [], null, 2)}

FORMAT:
{
  "answers": [
    { 
      "key": "<same question key>", 
      "answer": "EXTREMELY DETAILED response including: specific procedures performed, sample sizes calculated based on materiality and risk, exact testing methodologies, specific transactions tested, results obtained, exceptions found, conclusions drawn, and references to supporting documentation" 
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": "A plain-text string where:
    1. Classification lines MUST match exactly from INPUT (e.g., 'Assets > Current Assets', 'Expenses').
    2. NEVER use Markdown (#, *, _) or bullets in classification lines.
    3. Place each classification on its own line, followed by its recommendations.
    4. Recommendations under each classification should use '-' bullets and include: specific audit procedures to perform, sample sizing calculations, testing methodologies, documentation requirements, risk mitigation strategies, control improvements, and compliance actions
    5. Separate classifications with a single newline.
    6. Include QUANTITATIVE details: sample sizes based on materiality, error thresholds, testing coverage percentages
  "
}

GUIDELINES:
- Be HIGHLY SPECIFIC: include exact account numbers, amounts, dates, sample sizes, testing methodologies
- Perform CALCULATIONS: show sample size formulas, materiality-based thresholds, error rate calculations
- Reference SPECIFIC ETB accounts, transactions, balances, and risk factors
- Recommendations should be ACTIONABLE and DETAILED: specific procedures, documentation requirements, follow-up actions
- Include testing strategies for high-risk areas, fraud indicators, complex accounting treatments
- NEVER add/remove/merge classificationsâ€”use EXACTLY those provided.
- Cover all relevant assertions: existence, completeness, accuracy, cutoff, classification, rights/obligations
- Address internal controls, IT systems, fraud risks, and compliance requirements
