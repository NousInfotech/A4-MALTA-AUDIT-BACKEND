- Extended Trial Balance rows (array): {etbRows}

TASK:
Analyze the existing procedures and client context, then generate ONLY additional questions that should be added to enhance the audit planning. Do NOT return the entire procedures - only the new fields to be added.

GUIDELINES FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:

3. Address materiality considerations
4. Include questions that probe deeper into identified risks
5. Add questions for emerging risks or complex transactions
6. Consider regulatory requirements specific to this client
7. I want atleast 2-3 additional fields per section from you
8. DO NOT use the pilcrow (Â¶) symbol

FIELD TYPES TO USE:
- text/textarea: For narrative responses
- checkbox: For yes/no confirmations
- select: For multiple choice options
- multiselect: For selecting multiple options
- number/currency: For numeric inputs
